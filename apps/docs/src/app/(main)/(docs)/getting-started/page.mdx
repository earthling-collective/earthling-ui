# Getting Started with Earthling UI

Earthling UI is a modern, opinionated component library designed to help you build beautiful, accessible, and consistent user interfaces. It's built with a focus on developer experience and flexibility, allowing you to either import components directly or eject them into your project.

## Installation

Install Earthling UI in your project:

```bash
bun add earthling-ui
```

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Create a new project

The easiest way to get started is to create a new project using the Earthling UI CLI:

```bash
bunx earthling-ui create next my-app
```

This will create a new Next.js project with Earthling UI pre-configured. You can also use other templates like `spa` (Vite), `tauri` (desktop app), or `monorepo`.

### Option 2: Add to an existing project

1. Install the package as shown above
2. Import the CSS in your main CSS file:

```css
@import "earthling-ui";
```

3. Import components directly:

```jsx
import { Button } from "earthling-ui/button";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```

## Using Themes

Earthling UI comes with a default theme, but you can also import additional themes:

```css
@import "earthling-ui/theme/dark";
```

You can apply themes using CSS classes:

```jsx
<div className="theme-dark">
  {/* Components in here will use the dark theme */}
</div>
```
